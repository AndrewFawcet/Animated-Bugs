# Animated-Bugs

This is a program made early in the MSWDEV course. Made using JavaFX. The animation shows the ability to juggle multiple parameters in order to create a cohesive whole.

The bugs get hungry as they move, if hungry they will search for food. If food is in the nearby the bug will move towards it and eat, replenishing its energy levels. If the bug runs out of energy it dies.
The food is various 'plants' which are coloured circles that grow at a consistent rate. The plants get smaller when eaten by bugs, if they get too small they die.
 

some videos of the program running, randomly generated everytime.
